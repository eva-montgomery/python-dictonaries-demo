# Phone Book App
# You will write a command line program to manage a phone book. When you start the phonebook.py program, 
# it will print out a menu and ask the user to enter a choice:

# $ python3 phonebook.py
# Electronic Phone Book
# =====================
# 1. Look up an entry
# 2. Set an entry
# 3. Delete an entry
# 4. List all entries
# 5. Quit
